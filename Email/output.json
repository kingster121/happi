However, prior results in domains like image processing show that manipulating just a few bits in an adversarial setting may mislead the ML into patently wrong answers. These answers raise severe security concerns in emerging cyber-physical systems, e.g., online control of a low-carbon smart grid for agile adaptation to sustainable renewables. The power flows in question are subject to laws of physics, as well as concomitant checks for bad data, whose roles in the ML's cybersecurity are underexplored. In this paper, we adopt a tree ensemble model to provide novel tight lower bounds for the tolerance of physics-constrained ML against adversarial manipulation. The results illustrate impacts on a classical N-1 security problem for power systems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThis paper introduces the Kendall's tau unconstrained shrinkage regression for the classical mean-variance (M-VAR) method, or KUSR-MV, as a robust portfolio optimization approach.

So the message below is a reminder of what was shared earlier as I believe most of you now are working on the MA 1D project.\r\n\r\nFurther to what was shared earlier, the plots required in the 1D can be situated on each sheet (e.g. 45 cm 1st etc) with the ax, ay and az data. The ax_bar, ay_bar and az_bar required will come from the \"Stationary\" values (upright for ax, ay and tilted for az). There is no need to put the plots in the pdf.\r\n\r\nInstead, the pdf file will contain your solution to part 4i. Be \"warned\" that the algebra is not trivial - certainly more than a few lines so work through slowly and carefully. The purpose of the question is to work out (analytically) what is that critical C value that minimizes the error function given. Recall that the C here refers to the drag coefficient and the drag force is the drag coefficient multiplied by the square of the radius and the square of the velocity of the object.\r\n\r\nAn objective of the MA 1D is to use Excel for the plotting and the regression analysis. So any other method (e.g. Python) will not be accepted.\r\n\r\nNote that when you submit on eDimension, you need to submit both pdf and excel file.\r\n\r\nHope this clarifies a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nBernie\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nFrom: Ee Kuo Wei Bernard <bernard_ee@sutd.edu.sg>\r\nSent: Wednesday, November 1, 2023 7:14 PM\r\nTo: *Y2023 Students-UG-C02 <Y2023Students_UG_C02@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C06 <Y2023Students_UG_C06@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C11 <Y2023Students_UG_C11@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C01 <Y2023Students_UG_C01@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C03 <Y2023Students_UG_C03@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C04 <Y2023Students_UG_C04@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C05 <Y2023Students_UG_C05@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C06 <Y2023Students_UG_C06@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C07 <Y2023Students_UG_C07@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C08 <Y2023Students_UG_C08@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C09 <Y2023Students_UG_C09@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>; *Y2023 Students-UG-C10 <Y2023Students_UG_C10@mymail.sutd.edu.sg>\r\nCc: Ee Kuo Wei Bernard <bernard_ee@sutd.edu.sg>\r\nSubject: about your MA 1D\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nIt is heartening to see many of you also working on the MA 1D project and I understand that there have been some disquiet and consternation.\r\n\r\nSo I want to try my best to resolve this as much as possible.\r\n\r\nI apologize for my wordy response but I hope to give this overview. All will be made clear during the Design briefing that is happening next Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThe MA 1D project is related to your 2D which is about dropping an object from a certain height and this object has an attached parachute.\r\n\r\nSo before you throw the object, you will turn on the sensor. In the course of the object's drop, it will experience some free-fall and the parachute opens, hits the ground and then you will turn off the sensor.\r\n\r\nThe data you see in the 1D data file contains all of these recordings in this sequence. So, the intention is to familiarize you with what is going on for the actual drop in Week 11.\r\n\r\nOne must remember that when the object is stationary, it is already registering acceleration values in the x, y and z directions (see the upright stationary sheet). This of course assumes that the sensor has been turned on. Haha!!\r\n\r\nWe also need to consider the case when the object has been tilted (or rather when the sensor is being tilted) but stationary. This is because when the object is being dropped, it will experience an upright and tilted configuration.\r\n\r\nWhen the object is being thrown, we must not forget that the upright and tilted stationary data is also embedded in the sensor values.\r\n\r\nBut if we want to capture information pertaining to the drop of the object only (because our goal is to analyze the dynamics of the object being dropped), then we need to \"subtract out\" the stationary upright and tilted portions.\r\n\r\nThe idea in part 4b is to ensure that any systematic errors in computing the ax, ay and az are removed. One way this is done is to subtract each entry for ax, ay and az with the average values in tw. As such, the ar in part 4b should be close to g for all time entries because the object is still stationary.\r\n\r\nPart 4c seeks to just average this out since there is an ar for each time entry. And we can expect that the ar is close to g since the object is still stationary.\r\n\r\nPart 4d then showcases the time evolution of the object from the time it is being released to the time it hits the ground. So you can expect that the \"a\" value is initially 0 (as expected) because the object hasn't yet been thrown.\r\n\r\nSo if you follow the instructions in the 1D document, then you will see that the values of \"a\" in part 4d will initially be zero but it attains the free fall g value (as expected).\r\n\r\nThis makes sense since the object will experience free fall at some stage in its trajectory. The easiest way to visualize this is to plot the column of values that contains this \"a\" value (as per the formula in the 1D document). You can see that near the \"left end\" of the plot (the a hits g - this is the free fall portion).\r\n\r\nSo the idea behind all this is to help you to calibrate your instrument first (what parts 4a, b and c are about) so that from the sensor data (you obtain for the full drop - from object release to free-fall to parachute deployment to hitting the ground), you can determine the various phases of the drop from the sensor data.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry if the explanation is long but I hope it is helpful.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nBernie\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

It is very likely due to a lack of sleep. Since Sunday night, I have only been sleeping 2-3 hours a night. Too many things to do and manage. Haha!!\r\n\r\nI thought that by sleeping 7 hours last night was sufficient but it clearly was not. Used to be ok when I was younger (could do it for a week no problem) but clearly, I am getting old now. Haha!!\r\n\r\nBut I am feeling much better now - just need to slow down a little.\r\n\r\nHope all of you are doing ok too. Don't wait till you get dizzy like me and do get enough rest. Most importantly, stay emotionally sound - take it easy and just focus on what you can do, not what you haven't done.\r\n\r\nThis is the last phase of Term 1 so give it your best but remember to do your part (in the 1D and 2D) and get enough rest. We can fall sick easily when we are under stress and not getting enough sleep.\r\n\r\nThankfully, MA teaching will resume and wrap up in Week 12.....because I know that Weeks 10 and 11 will be very busy for you. So it is a good time for those who have fallen behind to catch up.\r\n\r\nThe mid-terms will be released next week in your one cohort class session. The solutions will be discussed in class and there will be time to seek help (in person) for your 2D and 1D (if needed).\r\n\r\nTake care and hope you had a good class with Eng Ying and DTP briefing today.\r\n\r\nVery shortly, I will be administering the make up exam and will load the HW 2 scores of the entire batch by hand.\r\n\r\nMiss all of you and looking forward to seeing all of you back in class next Wednesday (1100-1330); there is no class on Monday.\r\n\r\nNo worries, I will write to all the students about the special single class session in Week 10 this evening too. Details can be found in the module introduction too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nBernie\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

Are not currently consuming psychoactive medication\r\n  7.  Do not have major physical disability, disease, or motor disorder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to 1) complete some cognitive tests (no prior experience is required), and 2) answer some questionnaires about yourself and the cognitive tests. Depending on the group/condition you are in, you may also be asked to listen to music before or in between blocks of some tasks. Also depending on the group/condition you are in, you may be given different types of feedback related to your performance in the cognitive tasks(s). You will participate in one to two sessions, lasting about 3 hours in total. You will be compensated for your participation ($10 in voucher per hour). All data collected in the research will be kept strictly confidential. The study has been approved by the SUTD Institutional Review Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you meet our criteria and are interested to participate, please email the Language and Social Cognition Lab: psychlab@sutd.edu.sg<mailto:psychlab@sutd.edu.sg>\r\n\r\nwith the subject of your email: \u201cSign Up for MotivationStudy0004* and with your name and contact details.

Your feelings are completely understandable as you may feel that it is all too much and still have classes to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why for Maths, there is only 1 class next week (return and go through mid-term and help out in the MA component for 2D) and no class in Week 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose is two-fold: first to give all of you some breathing space to focus on your projects but also to allow those who are falling behind in Maths to catch up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Week 10, the single class session for the various cohorts are as follows: (same information as in the module information on eDimension).\r\n\r\nF01: Fri 17 Nov (1430-1700)\r\n\r\nF02: Wed 15 Nov (1100-1330)\r\n\r\nF03: Wed 15 Nov (1100-1330)\r\n\r\nF04: Thu 16 Nov (1230-1500)\r\n\r\nF05: Tue 14 Nov (1000-1230)\r\n\r\nF06: Tue 14 Nov (0900-1130)\r\n\r\nF07: Tue 14 Nov (1530-1800)\r\n\r\nF08: Tue 14 Nov (1530-1800)\r\n\r\nF09: Tue 14 Nov (1230-1500)\r\n\r\nF10: Tue 14 Nov (1400-1630)\r\n\r\nF11: Tue 14 Nov (1230-1500)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maths mid-term is being marked so please bear with us. When all the grading is done, I will enable the access and you can take a peek. I will send out an e-mail to everyone. The release of the marks on eDimension is to enable you to check to see if the mid-term exam paper is graded correctly and the tally matches with the eDimension scores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those that did not do as well as they had hoped for the mid-term, I want to encourage you to not lose hope and to see the exam as a diagnostic for where you stand \u2013 not just in terms of Maths but also in terms of how you have been studying and coping since day 1 this term. It is easy to be feel disheartened especially when so much effort was put in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOften times, it may not be the lack of effort but how that effort is being utilized in combination with how one manages examination anxieties. Fortunately, this is a pass/fail module so your goal is to cross the 50% mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who either failed the mid-term or didn\u2019t do as well as expected, DO NOT BE DISHEARTENED. Know what has to be put right (whether it is being more careful with working or clarify what was unclear previously; talk to your cohort instructors if needed) and focus on what needs to get done: to get the best marks possible for your 1D and the Maths component for 2D as well as the final exam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it helpful to have a plan as to what has to be done each day. It is tempting to just focus on one thing until it gets done. But I have found that this can sometimes lead to undue anxieties for the remaining tasks because we never know how long we need to spend on a particular task (especially if it is complex). Doing a little bit each day helps me to see \u201cprogress\u201d on all fronts and this in itself builds confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that for those who failed the mid-term, you will seek help from your cohort instructors and the PLS on Fridays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am happy to see students working hard because it shows that you are committed to making this term a meaningful one where you begin that journey of growth and maturity. What does working hard mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, it is not necessarily about how many hours you put in. Instead, it is about doing exhibiting that courage and determination to go out of your usual comfort zone and to put what needs to be put right being put right. But again, I hope that you are not Staying Up Till Dawn to get this done. Haha!! If so, then we need to think about how to work a little more smartly. \ud83d\ude03\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously, I hope that the more \u201crelaxed\u201d Maths class schedule in Weeks 10 and 11 will give you some time to catch your breath and get a bit more rest. Indeed when I talk to many students across the cohorts, this is indeed the case for the overwhelming majority of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will then come back to the lesson in Week 12 to wrap up Sections 3 and 4 of the final chapter. So the material will be completed by the end of Week 12. This is to allow you enough time to study and revise for your Maths final exam in Week 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo keep up the good and hard work, everyone! Proud of you! \ud83d\ude03\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nBernie\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

More specifically, can 3D-printing harness the Pollock's distinctive techniques to quickly and accurately print complex shapes?\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to know, can one replicate Jackson Pollock, and reverse engineer what he did,\u201d said L. Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and of Physics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).\r\n\r\nMahadevan and his team combined physics and machine learning to develop a new 3D-printing technique that can quickly create complex physical patterns \u2014 including replicating a segment of a Pollock painting \u2014 by leveraging the same natural fluid instability that Pollock used in his work.\r\n\r\nThe research is published in Soft Matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Designart Tokyo, Japanese design collective Honoka exhibited furniture and lighting made by 3D printing a material made from discarded Tatami mats.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition \u2013 titled Tatami Refab Project \u2013 displayed lampshades, lighting fixtures, tables, stools, basins and plant holders that appeared to glow thanks to the translucency of the material, which was made from grass and resin.\r\n\r\n\"Honoka has developed a unique material by mixing biodegradable resin with Igusa grass, which is extracted from Japanese discarded Tatami mats,\" said Honoka.\r\n\r\n\"Using ExtraBold's large 3D printer, the project proposes furniture that re-weaves Tatami into modern life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Igusa grass is cut from the mats and ground up, before being mixed with biodegradable resin.\r\n\r\nThe resulting pellets were fed through a large-format 3D printer and assembled to create a range of functional homewares and products.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScientists have developed a new method that can make customised 3D-printed metal parts containing different properties \u2013 such as having some regions of the metal stronger than others.\r\n\r\nThe new technique from the researchers \u2013 led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and University of Cambridge \u2013 uses 3D-printing steps. Unlike traditional metal manufacturing processes, it does not require additional raw materials, mechanical treatment or drastic machining processes to achieve a similar effect, such as coating the metal with a different material, thus potentially helping to reduce manufacturing costs.\r\n\r\nBesides designing a 3D-printed metal part with different strength levels, the new process should theoretically also allow manufacturers to design a part with other features, such as differing levels of electrical conductivity or corrosion resistance in the same metal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the AI summit well underway, researchers are keen to raise the very real problem associated with the technology \u2013 teaching it how to forget.\r\n\r\nSociety is now abuzz with modern AI and its exceptional capabilities; we are constantly reminded its potential benefits, across so many areas, permeating practically all facets of our lives \u2013 but also its dangers.\r\n\r\nIn an emerging field of research, scientists are highlighting an important weapon in our arsenal towards mitigating the risks of AI \u2013 \u2018machine unlearning\u2019.

Design Strategy for Trigonal Chloride Solid Electrolytes          The arrangement of metal ions (yttrium in this case) within each layer affects the ionic conductivity. To ensure the unobstructed movement of lithium ions, the number of metal ions occupying available sites within each layer should be less than 0.444. Furthermore, to create a sufficiently wide pathway for lithium ions within each layer, the occupancy of metal ions should be more than 0.167. Therefore, achieving an occupancy of metal ions between 0.167 and 0.444 within each layer results in a conductive layer with high ionic conductivity]\r\n\r\n[cid:image014.png@01DA13E0.3594FED0]\r\n\r\n[Three green flexible tubes enter a chambet with walls made of red plastic.]\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do we create buildings that use energy efficiently? Traditionally, efforts to green the built environment have centered on the physical infrastructure, often overlooking the relationships between people and space. The emergence of the technological era has ushered in \"Smart Buildings.\" that employ machine learning and automation. These innovative structures are designed to operate with impressive energy efficiency, however, they are largely disconnected from their occupants. What if buildings could be made smarter and more sustainable by engaging with their occupants?\r\n\r\n\"Buildings could be a lot smarter if we leverage the brains of the people inside of it\", shares Paul Ch\u00e1vez, Associate, User Experience and Technology Design at Arup, a global sustainable development company. Spearheading the project BREO (Building Resource Expression and Optimization), Ch\u00e1vez highlights the untapped potential of engaging occupants in actively conserving energy in buildings. Buildings consume a significant portion of the world's energy and resources, and yet its occupants often remain detached from the consequences of their energy consumption. BREO is a novel approach to tackling this problem, using sensory technology to create a more intuitive and interactive relationship between buildings and their inhabitants.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cResearchers led by Professor KANG Kisuk of the Center for Nanoparticle Research within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), have announced a major breakthrough in the field of next-generation solid-state batteries. It is believed that their new findings will enable the creation of batteries based on a novel chloride-based solid electrolyte that exhibits exceptional ionic conductivity\u2026\r\n\r\nThis research brings to light the often-overlooked role of metal ion distribution in the ionic conductivity of chloride-based solid electrolytes. It is expected that the IBS Center\u2019s research will pave the way for the development of various chloride-based solid electrolytes and further drive the commercialization of solid-state batteries, promising improved affordability and safety in energy storage.\r\n\r\nCorresponding author KANG Kisuk states, \u201cThis newly discovered chloride-based solid electrolyte is poised to transcend the limitations of conventional sulfide and oxide-based solid electrolytes, bringing us one step closer to the widespread adoption of solid-state batteries.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis research was published on November 3, 2023, in Science, which is one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cScientists from Japan have developed high-flowability liquefied stabilized soil from construction sludge that could revolutionize the sustainability of the construction industry.\r\n\r\nLiquefied stabilized soil (LSS) is made with construction waste and used for filling and backfilling long, confined spaces where traditional compaction is difficult. Using LSS helps speed up construction processes while reducing costs, wastage, and environmental impact. Now, researchers from Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan have developed a superior, high-flowability LSS from construction sludge with better mechanical properties and fluidity than conventional LSS, which could make the construction industry more sustainable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA soft robot can perform intricate surgical procedures inside a beating heart.\r\n\r\nThe motion of a pulsating heart, coupled with the narrow and delicate nature of blood vessels, makes minimally-invasive cardiac surgery challenging. To address this, Jacob Rogatinsky at Boston University in Massachusetts and his colleagues engineered a millimetre-scale robot that can enter the heart\u2019s chambers, and a stabilizing device that sits at the heart\u2019s entrance, in the large vein called the superior vena cava.\r\n\r\nThe stabilizer collapses to 8 millimetres in diameter for insertion into the body. Once it is threaded through the superior vena cava, it can expand to 32 millimetres. The robot, made of small balloon-like structures, can brace itself against the stabilizer and guide existing robotic surgical tools into the moving heart. A Nintendo Wii game controller is used to direct the machine.\r\n\r\nThe team tested the device on a pig\u2019s vena cava, 3D models of the heart\u2019s chambers and a pig\u2019s heart. They hope that future tests on live animals will confirm that the robot performs well and reveal any complications.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: Archdaily<https://www.archdaily.com/1008979/creating-energy-efficient-buildings-the-role-of-human-interaction-and-sensory-technology?ad_campaign=normal-tag> (30 Oct 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: IBS<https://www.ibs.re.kr/cop/bbs/BBSMSTR_000000000738/selectBoardArticle.do?nttId=24186&pageIndex=1&searchCnd=&searchWrd=> (3 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: SHIBAURA<https://www.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/headline/detail/20231101_7070_623_1.html> (1 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Nature<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03353-3> (2 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBERS\r\n\r\nFlexible Thermochromic Fabrics Enabling Dynamic Colored Display<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/969209>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAVERSE\r\n\r\nCan AI Make Architects Better Storytellers?<https://www.archdaily.com/1008735/can-ai-make-architects-better-storytellers?ad_campaign=normal-tag>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSTAINABILITY\r\n\r\nTwo Million European Single-Family Homes Could Abandon the Grid By 2050<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123004026?via%3Dihub>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRTUAL MEETINGS\r\n\r\nVirtual Meetings Tire People Because We're Doing Them Wrong<https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/virtual-meetings-tire-people-because-were-doing-them-wrong>\r\n\r\n[Flexible thermochromic fabrics enabling dynamic colored display]\r\n\r\n[cid:image017.jpg@01DA13E0.3594FED0]\r\n\r\n[cid:image018.jpg@01DA13E0.3594FED0]\r\n\r\n[Niina Nurmi, photo by Mikko Raskinen.]\r\n\r\n\u201cFibrous devices have attracted more and more research due to their unique one-dimensional morphological advantages such as flexibility, light weight and wearability. In the past decade, a variety of functional fibrous devices have been developed, including conductive, energy harvesting and memory devices, sensors, actuators and lighting devices. Among them, color-changing fibers provide a new direction for the research of new contemporary information display and human-computer interaction due to their extensibility and programmability. When the clothes people wear can change color and pattern instantly with the signal of external environment, it can not only enrich the aesthetics of the clothes itself, but also establish the bridge of natural interaction between users and environment, and realize the timely display and perception of environmental information.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by Prof. Guangming Tao at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China have been dedicated to research in the field of functional fibers. Prof. Tao\u2019s team has proposed a wet spinning process that can produce a variety of color reversible thermochromic fibers on a large scale, and its excellent mechanical properties and weaveability can be used to produce colorful fabric displays in everyday clothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis article is the sixth in a series focusing on the Architecture of the Metaverse. ArchDaily has collaborated with John Marx, AIA, the founding design principal and Chief Artistic Officer of Form4 Architecture, to bring you monthly articles that seek to define the Metaverse, convey the potential of this new realm as well as understand its constraints.\r\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence is at the genesis of creating fundamental changes in the way we design and construct buildings and cities. Some of these changes will be abrupt and disruptive to normative practice.  Others will take more time to feel the effect of this new technology, but the change will be pervasive.  When combined with the Metaverse, AI will also offer vast opportunities for the profession to expand and grow.  The kinds of spaces and environments we design in the Metaverse will be, in some aspects, very different from what we currently design in the physical world alone. AI evolves every day, and we are compelled to learn while we innovate. AI has proven it is a powerful tool to assist designers and offers the potential to challenge us to alter our design process. Combining AI with narrative design is one of those challenges.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRising energy procurement costs and declining capital costs for renewable technologies are provoking interest in self-sufficiency for individual buildings. In this study, we evaluate the potential of self-sufficient energy supply for 41 million freestanding single-family buildings under current and future (2050) conditions. We identify 4,000 representative buildings, calculate weather-robust cost-minimal energy systems, and transfer the optimization results to the entire European building stock. Our analyses show that buildings in regions with low seasonality and high electricity procurement costs have a high potential for self-sufficiency. Under current techno-economic conditions, 53% of the 41 million buildings are technically able to supply themselves independently from external infrastructures by only using local rooftop solar irradiation, and this proportion could increase to 75% by 2050. By paying a premium of up to 50% compared with grid-dependent systems with electrified heat supplies, building owners could make over two million buildings fully energy self-sufficient by 2050.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNew research suggests sleepiness during virtual meetings is caused by mental underload and boredom. Earlier studies suggested that fatigue from virtual meetings stems from mental overload, but new research from Aalto University shows that sleepiness during virtual meetings might actually be a result of mental underload and boredom.\r\n\r\n\u2018I expected to find that people get stressed in remote meetings. But the result was the opposite \u2013 especially those who were not engaged in their work quickly became drowsy during remote meetings,\u2019 says Assistant Professor Niina Nurmi, who led the study.\r\n\r\nThe researchers measured heart rate variability during virtual meetings and face-to-face meetings, examining different types of fatigue experiences among 44 knowledge workers across nearly 400 meetings. The team at Aalto collaborated with researchers at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, where stress and recovery are studied using heart rate monitors. The paper was published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: Eurekalert!<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/969209> (3 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Archdaily<https://www.archdaily.com/1008735/can-ai-make-architects-better-storytellers?ad_campaign=normal-tag> (2 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: SCIENCE DIRECT<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123004026?via%3Dihub> (2 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: AALTO<https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/virtual-meetings-tire-people-because-were-doing-them-wrong> (27 Oct 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view past Weekly Alerts CLICK HERE<https://mylibrary.sutd.edu.sg/discovery-alerts-weekly-archive>\r\n\r\nFor more articles or in-depth research, contact us at library@sutd.edu.sg<mailto:library@sutd.edu.sg>\r\n\r\nA SUTD Library Service\u00a92023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

The marks for the mid-term have been officially released. The average (as of 10 Nov) is 28.78/44. I say as of 10 Nov as you have not had the chance to take a peek at the paper so they may be revisions. However, I do not expect that the average to deviate much from this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The Homework 1 score is marked out of 21 instead of 20 \u2013 as per the original arrangement. Apologies for any confusion this may have caused. This will not make a significant change in your overall scores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The solutions to the remaining Practice Questions for Chapter 6 is now available on eDimension as there were requests for early release as a way to help students better manage their schedules. ??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The solutions to the mid-term will be e-mailed to all of you sometime this Sunday so that you can take a look at it. Next week, in your single class session with your instructors, they will go through the mid-term as well as provide guidance (if needed) on your maths related projects. The important thing is to make sure that your scripts were marked correctly and the sum of the points is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  During the mid-term review, you are allowed to take pictures of your scripts to help you to review and prepare for your final exam. However, they will be collected back at the end of the review because they are needed for quality control purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The weighted total is given to you as a guide to help you to track your progress towards the 50% mark \u2013 which is currently the pass mark for the entire module. So right now, your score should be seen as being out of 36.33% (2 homework, 5.66% each and 1 mid-term, 25%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The final exam is out of 25% and will mainly focus on Chapter 5 and 6. However, you are required to know differentiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  For the final exam, you will be given a table of integrals. Please see attached for your reference. I will release this again closer to the end of the term so that everyone remembers. However, I thought to release it now so that you can begin to prepare your cheat sheet if you know what is going to be provided in the final exam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any further questions. I wish everyone a blessed, restful and hopefully productive weekend ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo our Hindu friends, a blessed Diwali.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

This is to enable you to make comparisons between your answers and that of the solutions. At the end of the exam review, your scripts will be collected back for quality control purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is important to ensure that your solutions to the short answer and modelling parts are logical and systematic - regardless of the approach taken. This is important because a common issue experienced in general (for all modules) is that markers don't understand what is being written and the onus is on the student to ensure that what is on your mind is accurately communicated on paper. This is why examinations are a multi-faceted assessment mode - it is not just to reflect what you know but it is also to write down what you know too.\r\n\r\nA number of students made careless mistakes in this exam and being a foundational module, it is important that students be able to work through relatively basic problems accurately and not just count on getting part marks for\r\nworking done for basic problems.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to a number of you, I know that some of you might be feeling disappointed with your Maths examination results. This is understandable but I want to encourage all of you to look at the bigger picture here. In good time, you will forget what you got in this exam but I hope that you will be able to retain and further develop your understanding of the concepts taught in this module.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things to be done - such as your 1D and 2D projects. Together for Maths, the 1D and 2D projects make up 30% of your final mark. So do not lose hope but at the same time, don't over-strategize - aim to shoot for how many percent for 1D and 2D. Such efforts (while understandable) are usually futile because a lot depends on your group mates. Thus, the effort must be channeled towards ensuring an accurate (as best as possible) and timely completion and submission of the projects.\r\n\r\nThere is also the final exam and so I hope that for those who didn't do well in the exam, you will take the opportunity to take stock and see what needs to be rectified to improve in the next two weeks. Though this is a busy period for everyone, I hope that you will use the empty slots for Maths strategically. \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\nIf you have concerns about your development in Maths, then do get in touch with your cohort instructors.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good and hard work, everyone! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nBernie\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

People walk behind him.]\r\n\r\n[cid:image011.jpg@01DA195E.930DDB30]\r\n\r\n\u201cA team of engineers from the University of Illinois has published the first known study documenting the long-jumping motion of 3D-printed insect-scale robots.\r\n\r\nThe new study, published in the journal Smart Materials and Structures, follows a previous publication that documented the same lab\u2019s investigation of vertical jumping in insect-scale robots. The study is led by Professor Sameh Tawfick, an associate professor and Ralph A. Andersen Faculty Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering. His lab, the Kinetic Materials Research Group, studies the development of artificial muscles as part of its focus on bio-inspired materials manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo my knowledge, this is the first time anyone has demonstrated long jumping in insect-scale robots,\u201d Tawfick said of his lab\u2019s accomplishment. \u201cThis is significant because it gives the robot planned mobility, where it can now jump from A to B, traversing terrain rougher than its own size.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cResearchers in China have developed a robot chemist powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that might be able to extract oxygen from water on Mars. The robot uses materials found on the red planet to produce catalysts that break down water, releasing oxygen. The idea could complement existing oxygen-generating technologies or lead to the development of other catalysts able to synthesize useful resources on Mars.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you think about the challenge of going to Mars, you have to work with local materials,\u201d says Andy Cooper, a chemist at the University of Liverpool, UK. \u201cSo, I can see the logic behind it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe study, published in Nature Synthesis, was led by Jun Jiang at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. Jiang and his team used a mobile machine the size of a refrigerator with a robotic arm to analyse five meteorites that had either come from Mars or been collected on Earth but mimicked the Martian surface. The team\u2019s goal was to investigate whether the machine could produce useful catalysts from the material.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost anyone who\u2019s used noise-canceling headphones knows that hearing the right noise at the right time can be vital. Someone might want to erase car horns when working indoors, but not when walking along busy streets. Yet people can\u2019t choose what sounds their headphones cancel.\r\n\r\nNow, a team led by researchers at the University of Washington has developed deep-learning algorithms that let users pick which sounds filter through their headphones in real time. The team is calling the system \u201csemantic hearing.\u201d Headphones stream captured audio to a connected smartphone, which cancels all environmental sounds. Either through voice commands or a smartphone app, headphone wearers can select which sounds they want to include from 20 classes, such as sirens, baby cries, speech, vacuum cleaners and bird chirps. Only the selected sounds will be played through the headphones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cViolent cities result from social and economic inequality, which also affects the urban landscape and the way we live. In honor of International Cities Day, we have selected a series of projects to reflect on non-violent ways of using public space.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Mexican NGO Seguridad, Justicia y Paz (safety, justice and peace) published a list of the 50 most violent cities in the world based on the rate of homicides per 100,000 citizens. Brazil has 17 of the 50 most violent cities, followed by Mexico with 12, Venezuela with 5, and the United States with 4. Meanwhile, the Gini index, a statistical measure to represent the income inequality within a nation or a social group, shows that the four aforementioned countries, as well as the others in the ranking, all have high coefficients, between 41 and 53, meaning they have a high degree of income inequality among their population. It is important to point out that all these countries were colonized and have been victims of genocide and mass slavery throughout history, resulting in a social structure that marginalizes minorities.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: Eurekalert!<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007913> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Nature<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03522-4> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: UW<https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/09/ai-noise-canceling-headphones/> (9 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Archdaily<https://www.archdaily.com/969940/cultivating-non-violent-cities-10-examples-of-friendly-public-spaces> (31 Oct 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGY\r\n\r\nEnergy Transition: A Super-Model to Guide Policy Makers<https://www.unige.ch/medias/en/2023/transition-energetique-un-super-modele-pour-guider-les-politiques>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTHCARE\r\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence: Unexpected Results<https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/209-2023>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE LEARNING\r\n\r\nUsing Deep Learning to Process Raw Photoacoustic Channel Data and Guide Cardiac Interventions<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007917>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMICONDUCTORS\r\n\r\nThermal Transistors Handle Heat with No Moving Parts<https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermal-transistor>\r\n\r\n[cid:image012.jpg@01DA195E.930DDB30]\r\n\r\n[Relative proportions of edges in protein-ligand interaction graphs]\r\n\r\n[A photoacoustic approach to guiding cardiac catheters involves short laser pulses delivered using an optical fiber attached to a catheter, while a special signal transducer picks up the ensuing ultrasound waves generated within the heart.]\r\n\r\n[close up of a computer chip with an orange wavy line coming out the middle]\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we ensure that an energy policy will achieve its objectives? To find out, scientists and public authorities can rely on computer models of varying degrees of accuracy. However, these models have a number of limitations, including the fact that they are not very effective for generating projections on a regional scale. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) has designed a super-model to simulate the spread of three green technologies in Swiss municipalities by 2050. It is based on available statistics and combines twelve existing models of technology growth, while testing their relevance. The results, published in the journal PNAS Nexus, could help inform political decision-making.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArtificial intelligence (AI) is on the rise. Until now, AI applications generally have \u201cblack box\u201d character: How AI arrives at its results remains hidden. Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Bajorath, a cheminformatics scientist at the University of Bonn, and his team have developed a method that reveals how certain AI applications work in pharmaceutical research. The results are unexpected: the AI programs largely remembered known data and hardly learned specific chemical interactions when predicting drug potency. The results have now been published in \"Nature Machine Intelligence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCardiovascular diseases rank among the top causes of death across the world, and cardiac interventions are similarly very common. For example, cardiac catheter ablation procedures, which are used to treat arrythmias, number in several tens of thousands per year in the US alone. In these procedures, surgeons insert a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into the femoral vein in the leg and navigate their way up to the heart, where the problematic tissue is destroyed using cold or focused radiation.\r\n\r\nEven though cardiac catheter-based procedures are considered minimally invasive, the position of the catheter tip must be carefully monitored and controlled to prevent damage to the heart. In most cases, surgeons rely on fluoroscopy to localize and guide the catheter tip. However, this approach exposes both the patient and the medical staff to ionizing radiation, which can lead to problems such as increased risk of cancer or birth defects.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cElectronic transistors are central to modern electronics. These devices precisely control the flow of electricity, but in doing so, they generate heat. Now, researchers at the University of California Los Angeles have developed a solid-state thermal transistor\u2014the first device of its kind that can use an electric field to control the flow of heat through electronics. Their study, which was recently published in Science, demonstrates the capabilities of the new technology.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been a strong desire from engineers and scientists to control heat transfer the same way we control electronics, but it has been very challenging,\u201d says study lead author Yongjie Hu, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at UCLA.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: UNIGE<https://www.unige.ch/medias/en/2023/transition-energetique-un-super-modele-pour-guider-les-politiques> (6 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: UNI BONN<https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/209-2023> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Eurekalert!<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007917> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: IEEE Spectrum<https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermal-transistor> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSTAINABILITY\r\n\r\nFood Waste Prevention in Europe Can Generate Major Footprint Savings<https://food.ku.dk/english/news/2023/politicians-can-prevent-major-food-loss-and-waste-in-the-food-chain-from-farm-to-table-in-europe/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSTAINABLE DESIGN\r\n\r\nDissolvable Binder for EV Batteries Wins 2023 Earthshot Prize<https://www.dezeen.com/2023/11/08/earthshot-prize-winners-2023/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\r\n\r\n\"Zoom Fatigue\": Exhaustion Caused by Video Conferencing Proven on A Neurophysiological Level for The First Time<https://www.tugraz.at/en/tu-graz/services/news-stories/tu-graz-news/singleview/article/zoom-fatigue-ermuedung-durch-videokonferenzen-erstmals-neurophysiologisch-nachgewiesen>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARFARE\r\n\r\n21st Century Total Wars Will Enlist Technologies in Ways We Don\u2019t Yet Understand, Writes Jordan Richard Schoenherr<https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2023/11/08/21st-century-total-wars-will-enlist-technologies-in-ways-we-dont-yet-understand-writes-jordan-richard-schoenherr.html>\r\n\r\n[Food Waste]\r\n\r\n[cid:image017.jpg@01DA195E.930DDB30]\r\n\r\n[A man is sitting in front of a screen attanding a videoconference.]\r\n\r\n[Ukraine flag digitized]\r\n\r\n\u201cNew calculations show that the European countries have great potential for reducing the demand for global food resources and the associated GHG footprint. Researchers have estimated the climate footprint savings that may be obtained from reducing food loss and waste along Europe\u2019s food supply chain by 50 % by 2030\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cHalving Europe\u2019s food loss and waste, together with a redistribution of global food resources, could solve the challenges of food shortages in the world,\u201d says Marianne Thomsen, research leader and professor of sustainable food systems at the Department of Food Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH FOOD).\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrince William has announced the five projects that are taking home this year's Earthshot Prize, including an AI-powered soil carbon marketplace and a more circular manufacturing process for lithium-ion batteries.\r\n\r\nFounded by the British royal in 2021, the annual Earthshot Prize rewards innovative solutions to the world's most pressing environmental challenges \u2013 air and water pollution, environmental degradation, waste and climate change.\r\n\r\nFrom more than 1,100 entries, a winner was chosen for each of these five categories and awarded a \u00a31 million cash prize to help scale up the project and increase its positive impact.\r\n\r\n\"Our winners and all our finalists remind us that, no matter where you are on our planet, the spirit of ingenuity and the ability to inspire change surrounds us all,\" Prince William said in a speech at the awards ceremony in Singapore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in virtual interactions has created a new challenge: fatigue caused by video calls, also known as Zoom fatigue or videoconference fatigue. This exhaustion, characterized by a feeling of tiredness and alienation due to too long or inappropriate video-based communication, had previously only been investigated through surveys and self-assessments by users. An interdisciplinary research team led by Ren\u00e9 Riedl from the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria/Campus Steyr and Gernot M\u00fcller-Putz from Graz University of Technology has now managed to provide neurophysiological evidence of videoconference fatigue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs new technologies like artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones and so-called \u2018cyberweapons\u2019 such as malware and Internet-based disinformation campaigns become integral to our daily lives, researchers are working to grasp the role they will play in warfare.\r\n\r\nJordan Richard Schoenherr, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, writes in a new paper that our understanding of warfare is now outdated. The role sociotechnical systems\u2014meaning the way technology relates to human organizational behaviour in a complex, interdependent system\u2014plays in strategic thinking is still far from fully developed. Understanding their potential and their vulnerabilities will be an important task for planners in the years ahead.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource: UOC<https://food.ku.dk/english/news/2023/politicians-can-prevent-major-food-loss-and-waste-in-the-food-chain-from-farm-to-table-in-europe/> (6 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Dezeen<https://www.dezeen.com/2023/11/08/earthshot-prize-winners-2023/> (8 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: TUGRAZ<https://www.tugraz.at/en/tu-graz/services/news-stories/tu-graz-news/singleview/article/zoom-fatigue-ermuedung-durch-videokonferenzen-erstmals-neurophysiologisch-nachgewiesen> (13 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\nSource: Concordia<https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2023/11/08/21st-century-total-wars-will-enlist-technologies-in-ways-we-dont-yet-understand-writes-jordan-richard-schoenherr.html> (8 Nov 2023)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view past Weekly Alerts CLICK HERE<https://mylibrary.sutd.edu.sg/discovery-alerts-weekly-archive>\r\n\r\nFor more articles or in-depth research, contact us at library@sutd.edu.sg<mailto:library@sutd.edu.sg>\r\n\r\nA SUTD Library Service\u00a92023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestricted\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.

These two questions require you to REALLY understand integration. Apologies if I am disturbing you.\r\n\r\nQ3: Here is the trick....use the definition of integration and differentiation in a \"different\" way.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have the integral of f(t) = g(t).\r\n\r\nThen, dg/dt = f(t). Yes?\r\n\r\nAlso, we have\r\n\r\nintegral of f(t) from t=a to t=b is given by g(b) - g(a). Yes? This is the evaluation theorem from the notes.\r\n\r\nSo recognize that if we now replace a and b by 2 and 2x^2 respectively and if f(t)=sqrt(4+t^2)/(4t), then\r\n\r\nG(x) = g(2x^2) - g(2).\r\n\r\nSo how do we find G'(x)? How do we differentiate g(2x^2). Good revision of midterm material. \ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\nQ4: What is the equation of a circle of radius c and what does the integral of that equation mean? How does this link to the area of a portion of a circle?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these two questions is to try to get everyone to think along the lines of not just first going after a formula when you see an integral but to pause first and see what the integral is actually \"saying\" to us.\r\n\r\nHope the above helps.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good and hard work, everyone. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings\r\nBernie\r\n\r\nThis email may contain confidential and/or proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under applicable law and is intended for receipt and use solely by the addressee(s) named above.
